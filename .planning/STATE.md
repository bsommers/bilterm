# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-10-19)

**Core value:** A responsive composite terminal pane (movable/resizable floating command prompt over a full-PTY output canvas that scrolls underneath) that can be split horizontally/vertically, stacked/shuffled in z-order via keyboard or mouse, styled with classic IBM 3270 mainframe & DOS Borland Turbo Vision aesthetics, and integrated seamlessly with `tmux`.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Core PTY, VT100 Engine & Single CompositePane Prototype

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Core PTY, VT100 Engine & Single CompositePane Prototype)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-10-19 — Roadmap and requirements traceability initialized (26 v1 requirements across 5 phases)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Composite Window Pane (`OutputCanvas` + `FloatingPrompt` + `OiaStatusBar`) is the atomic layout unit across all H/V splits and z-order stacks.
- [Init]: Child PTY dimensions stay fixed to full `OutputCanvas` rect so moving/resizing/hiding `FloatingPrompt` never triggers `SIGWINCH` reflow storms.
- [Init]: Three-signal input routing (`OSC 133` + `tcgetpgrp` + `termios !ECHO` + `DECSET 1049`) prevents `sudo` password echo leaks and interactive REPL lockouts.
- [Init]: Custom `occlude_rect` buffer pass sanitizes split 2-column wide graphemes at floating prompt, stacked pane, Guake drop-down overlay, and Turbo Vision drop-shadow boundaries.
